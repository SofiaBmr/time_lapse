# Part 3 - TP3 - Timer log

In this part, we will create a python decorator to monitor the time taken by the execution of a function. To test it, weâ€™ll make two implementations of a function that count each word in the Shakespear artwork.

Download the repo and launch the following command on your terminal :
```bash
    python counting.py
```
